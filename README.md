# Clickable Nanobot Experience
#### by Luis Sanchez


## Overview
Utilizes the p5 Clickable library to create an interactive experience focused on 
a series of fictional nanobots.

The page displays an image of the nanobot in the center in an idle animation. Below
it are a series of 5 interactive buttons that interact with the nanobots in different
ways.

1. Search Mode Description - Describes what the search mode of the nanobot does.
2. Operation Mode Description - Describes what the operation mode of the nanobot does.
3. Add Nanobot - Adds a nanobot to the background, once 30 nanobots are on screen, they are mobilized and move off the screen.
4. Remove Nanobot - Removes a nanobot from the background
5. Toggle Modes - This button will toggle between the search and operation mode of the nanobot, which is visually different.

## Usage
The main interactions are tied to the 5 buttons on the canvas, they each do different things, so play around with them to learn more about the nanobots!
